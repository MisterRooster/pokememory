          Try to click on as many cards as possible without
          choosing the same card twice.
          The pokemons are getting reordered randomly after every choice.
          You beat a level when there is no unique card left to choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          On every level one additional pokemon joins and you get a time bonus.
          The faster you are the higher your score!

          Don't let time run out and Have fun playing!
